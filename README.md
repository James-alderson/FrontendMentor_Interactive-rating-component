### What I learned

In this project I learned to used `focus` and `blur` javaScript events.

The `focus` event fires when an element has received focus.

The `blur` event fires when an element has lost focus.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
ranks.forEach(rank => {
  rank.addEventListener("focus", focusFunc)
  rank.addEventListener("blur", blurFunc)
})
```
